## How it works

"The Project is a half adder that uses three and gates and two Xor gates to add 2 1 bit numbers"

## How to test

"You change the inputs and see the output change based on the lights illuminating, the blue light represents the sum bit and the white light is the carry bit"

## External hardware

"Two LED displays to see the output"
